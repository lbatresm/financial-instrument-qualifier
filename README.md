# FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT QUALIFIER

## Why Open FIGI?
OpenFIGI is Bloomberg's public API that provides access to the global database of FIGI (Financial Instrument Global Identifier) ​​identifiers.
Its mission is to unify financial instrument identifiers (stocks, bonds, ETFs, funds, derivatives, indices, etc.) through a unique, standardized ID.

Each instrument has a FIGI (for example: BBG000B9XRY4 for AAPL US Equity).

Since each data source in the internet can use a different identifier for financial instruments (ISIN, Ticker, CUSIP, SEDOL...), the Financial Instrument Global Identifier allows us to correlate them and avoid dupplications in our system.
